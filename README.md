Fine tune GPT2 on Trump's 2020 rally speeches to generate some hilarious speeches.


Example: 
>"The media is - really, the word, I think one of the greatest of all terms I've come up with - is fake. They don't like to use those words. Then CNN used one of the greatest words ever used to describe the job we do, the job we're doing with the world. That should have been a phrase used by him. That's not even a word. That's probably my worst phrase ever. We're building a wall, a wall, right now. That's good. All of us have built a wall all of us, and he did a great job. It started being that way for eight years, seven years, nine years, and then there was another wall built, which he's going to be paying a fortune for. He's going to spend much more money, much more money, I think, money you should see. I think he's got the best year on record. And now it's getting better, and they said, "Oh, he never used those words, but he used those exact words." I got out, and I said, look, I do think he will. And he could be spending the rest of his career as if he was doing a great job.
